  but this step may be omitted.) 
  Pour into 2 heatproof pudding cups 
  then place onto a plate filled with 100 ml of water (amount separate from listed ingredients) 
  and cover with foil. 
  (I used aluminum bento cups.) 
  Microwave one at a time at 600 W for 1:50. 
  Let cool as-is. 
  If the tops have lightly browned and are set 
  it's okay 
  but if it's still soft and creamy 
  microwave some more. 
  The amount of heating time will vary depending on the size of the plate. 
  If it hasn't hardened yet 
  keep heating for 10 seconds at a time. 
  The second cup's water will have already become hot 
  so maybe 1:40 will be okay? 
  I tried covering it with a small plate. 
  This is also okay. 
  Either aluminum foil or a flipped-over lid will do fine. 
  You can heat them two at a time 
  but it will heat more evenly if you do it one at a time. 
  It's ready 
  and tastes great even when eaten plain. 
  If you don't strain it 
  the egg white and yolk... well 
  you can see what happened. 
  It's still delicious 
  but doesn't look so great. 
  If you over-heat it 
  it'll have craters. 
  Top with your favorite caramel sauce and enjoy. 
  How about trying my microwaved caramel sauce?

  aluminum foil sparks but for some reason 
  in this case it only sparks on the inside."|226.0|114.0|7.0|5.7|45.5|Salty|2|Baked|American|5.0|Dessert|Eggs|vegetarian|"Custard Pudding Easily Made in the Microwave

  Strain through a strainer. 
  (This is to make it smooth 
  but this step may be omitted.) 
  Pour into 2 heatproof pudding cups 
  then place onto a plate filled with 100 ml of water (amount separate from listed ingredients) 
  and cover with foil. 
  (I used aluminum bento cups.) 
  Microwave one at a time at 600 W for 1:50. 
  Let cool as-is. 
  If the tops have lightly browned and are set 
  it's okay 
  but if it's still soft and creamy 
  microwave some more. 
  The amount of heating time will vary depending on the size of the plate. 
  If it hasn't hardened yet 
  keep heating for 10 seconds at a time. 
  The second cup's water will have already become hot 
  so maybe 1:40 will be okay? 
  I tried covering it with a small plate. 
  This is also okay. 
  Either aluminum foil or a flipped-over lid will do fine. 
  You can heat them two at a time 
  but it will heat more evenly if you do it one at a time. 
  It's ready 
  and tastes great even when eaten plain. 
  If you don't strain it 
  the egg white and yolk... well 
  you can see what happened. 
  It's still delicious 
  but doesn't look so great. 
  If you over-heat it 
  it'll have craters. 
  Top with your favorite caramel sauce and enjoy. 
  How about trying my microwaved caramel sauce? 
  When microwaving 
  aluminum foil sparks but for some reason 
  in this case it only sparks on the inside."|food_3763

  Roll each portion into a ball and then flatten it into the shape of a burger. 
  Push down on the center of the burger lightly with your thumb to make a small indention; this will keep it from turning into a baseball once it is cooked. 
  You can pan fry these burgers or cook them on a grill. 
  Lightly coat the grill or pan with oil before you turn on the heat 
  this will keep the meat from sticking. 
  The trick to grilling/cooking these burgers is to place them on a really hot grill at max heat for the first 30 seconds or so. 
  This will sear the outside making it easier to keep the burger intact when its time to be flipped. 
  Then just be sure not to touch them until they are ready to be flipped (about 5 to 6 minutes).

  1.
