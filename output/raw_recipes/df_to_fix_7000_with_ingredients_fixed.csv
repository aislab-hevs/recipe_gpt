- 2 tablespoons almond butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2-4 tablespoons water or as needed
- additional coatings (such as shredded coconut, cocoa powder, or crushed almonds) for rolling

3. **blend dry ingredients**:
   - in a food processor, combine the toasted almonds, rolled oats, chia seeds, and flaxseeds.
   - pulse until the mixture is coarsely ground.

4. **add wet ingredients**:
   - to the mixture in the food processor, add the drained dates, almond butter, vanilla extract, and salt.
   - process until a sticky dough-like consistency is formed. if the mixture seems too dry, add water one tablespoon at a time until it sticks together when pressed. be careful not to add too much water, or the mixture will become too sticky.

5. **form the balls**:
   - take small portions of the mixture and roll them into balls using your hands. if the mixture sticks to your hands, wet them slightly before rolling.
   - each ball should be about 1 inch in diameter, but you can adjust the size to your preference.

6. **coat the balls** (optional):
   - roll the energy balls in your choice of coating such as shredded coconut, cocoa powder, or crushed toasted almonds until evenly covered.
   - this step is optional but adds an extra flavor and texture to your energy balls.

7. **chill and store**:
   - place the energy balls on a tray or container lined with parchment paper.
   - chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour to set. this helps them firm up and become less sticky.

- 1-2 cloves of garlic, peeled and cut in half
- extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling
- coarse salt (sea salt or kosher salt), to taste
- optional: serrano ham or anchovies, for topping

**"|"

1. **toast the bread:**
   - preheat your oven broiler or grill, or use a toaster.
   - lightly toast the slices of bread until they're golden and crispy. you can grill or broil them for about 1 to 2 minutes per side, depending on the heat.

2. **rub with garlic:**
   - once the bread is toasted, while it's still warm, rub one side of each slice with the cut side of the garlic cloves. the rough texture of the toasted bread will help grate the garlic and infuse it into the bread.

3. **grate or rub the tomato:**
   - cut the tomatoes in half crosswise. using the larger grated side of a box grater, grate the tomato halves over a bowl, being careful to keep the skin intact. alternatively, you can simply rub the cut side of the tomato halves directly onto the toasted bread. the goal is to coat the bread with the tomato flesh.

4. **drizzle with olive oil:**
   - generously drizzle olive oil over the tomato-coated bread. the bread should have a nice sheen of oil but not be overly saturated.

5. **season:**
   - sprinkle coarse salt over the slices to taste. 

6. **optional toppings:**
   - if you want to add a layer of flavor, you can top the bread with thin slices of serrano ham or a few anchovies.

7. **serve:**
   - enjoy the pan con tomate immediately, while the bread is still crisp.

- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup (240ml) warm water
- 1 tbsp olive oil

for the filling:
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 10 oz (300g) spinach, washed and roughly chopped
- 7 oz (200g) feta cheese, crumbled
- salt and pepper, to taste
- a pinch of ground nutmeg (optional)

to cook:
- butter or olive oil, for brushing the gözleme
- extra flour, for rolling out the dough

"|"1. start by making the dough. in a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt. gradically add the warm water and olive oil, and mix until a dough starts to form.

2. knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-8 minutes until it's smooth and elastic. if the dough is too sticky, add a little extra flour; if it's too dry, add a bit more water.

3. divide the dough into 4-6 equal pieces, shape them into balls, cover them with a damp cloth, and let them rest for about 30 minutes to an hour.

4. while the dough is resting, prepare the filling. heat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat. add the finely chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until they're soft and fragrant.

5. add the chopped spinach to the pan, and cook until it wilts. season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg if using.

6. remove the pan from the heat, and let the mixture cool slightly. stir in the crumbled feta cheese. adjust the seasoning if necessary.

7. on a floured surface, roll out one of the dough balls into a thin circle about 9-10 inches in diameter.

8. spread a portion of the spinach and feta mixture over one half of the circle, leaving a small border around the edge to seal the gözleme.

9. fold the dough over to enclose the filling, pressing the edges to seal.

10. heat a large frying pan or griddle over medium heat. brush one side of the gözleme with a little butter or olive oil, and place it oil-side-down in the pan.

11. while cooking, brush the top with more butter or oil. flip the gözleme once it's golden brown and crispy on the bottom – this should take about 2-3 minutes.

12. cook the other side until golden brown and the filling is hot, another 2-3 minutes.

13. remove from the pan and lay on a cutting board. cut into slices and serve warm.

14. repeat the process with the remaining dough balls and filling.

    b. brush or drizzle the marinade generously over the skewers, coating the vegetables and vegan feta.
    c. let the skewers sit in the marinade for about 15 minutes to absorb the flavors, turning them once halfway through.

    Calories: 400 per portion
    Servings: 2
    Allergic Warnings: Gluten
    Origin Country: Malaysia

"|halal|400.0||food_4313|"**
- 3 cups of all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1 tablespoon of sugar
- 1 cup of water (or as needed to form a dough)
- 1 large egg (optional, for extra richness)
- 2 tablespoons of condensed milk (optional, for extra richness and sweetness)
- 2 tablespoons of ghee or unsalted butter, melted, plus extra for greasing and cooking
- vegetable oil, for greasing

"|"**

1. **dough making:**
   - in a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. 
   - if you're using egg and condensed milk, whisk them together with the water before adding to the dry ingredients; otherwise, just slowly add water to the dry ingredients.
   - gradually add the water (with the egg and condensed milk mixture if you're using it), mixing until the dough begins to come together. 
   - pour in the melted ghee or butter and knead the dough for about 10 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. you may need to adjust the amount of water or flour slightly to get the right consistency.

2. **dough resting:**
   - divide the dough into small balls (about golf ball size or slightly larger).
   - grease each ball lightly with vegetable oil.
   - place the dough balls on a tray or plate, making sure they're not touching, and cover loosely with plastic wrap. 
   - let them rest for at least 4 hours, or overnight. this resting period allows the gluten in the dough to relax, which will make it easier to stretch the roti canai later.

3. **dough stretching:**
   - when ready to cook, work with one ball of dough at a time on a lightly oiled countertop.
   - flatten the ball and start stretching it with your hands to form a very thin sheet. you can lift and toss the dough or use your fingers to stretch it out. the goal is to get it as thin as possible without tearing, aiming for a translucent sheet.

4. **shaping:**
   - once the dough is stretched, fold the edges in to form a rectangle; fold the top and bottom edges towards the center, then fold the left and right edges.
   - you can also roll the stretched dough like a rug from one end to the other, then coil into a round snail shape and tuck the end underneath.

5. **cooking:**
   - heat a non-stick pan or flat griddle over medium heat.
   - flatten the shaped dough slightly with your hands, then use a rolling pin to roll it out to your desired thickness.
   - grease the pan with a little bit of ghee or oil and place the roti canai on it.
   - cook until the underside is golden brown and crispy, then flip it to cook the other side.
   - while it's cooking, you can also press the edges and lightly toss or flip the roti in the pan to ensure even cooking.
   - remove from the pan when both sides are cooked, and it's crispy and flaky.
   - as an optional step, you can clap the roti between your hands to fluff it up and separate the layers, making it more fluffy and airy.

6. **serving:**
   - roti canai is traditionally served with dhal (lentil curry), chicken curry, or any other type of curry. 
   - fold or roll the roti into quarters and serve it warm alongside your dip or curry of choice.
