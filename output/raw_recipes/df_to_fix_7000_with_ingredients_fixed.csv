for the butter layer (beurrage):
- 250 grams high-quality unsalted butter, cold

for finishing:
- 1 egg (for egg wash)

### "|"
#### day 1

##### step 1: preparing the dough
1. in a large mixing bowl (or a stand mixer bowl), combine the flour, sugar, salt, and instant yeast. mix together briefly.
2. add the warm milk, warm water, and melted butter. mix with a dough hook attachment on a low speed until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, roughly 5-8 minutes (or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface).
3. shape the dough into a flat rectangle. wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or overnight).

##### step 2: preparing the butter layer
1. place the cold butter between two pieces of parchment paper or in a plastic bag. using a rolling pin, pound and roll the butter into a rectangle about 8 inches by 5 inches (20 cm by 13 cm).
2. keep the edges of the butter as straight as possible, and try to maintain an even thickness throughout. refrigerate the butter layer until it's well-chilled, at least 30 minutes.

#### day 2

##### step 3: encasing the butter
1. remove the dough and the butter from the refrigerator. on a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a rectangle that is twice the size of your butter layer.
2. place the butter on one half of the dough rectangle. fold the other half of the dough over the butter, sealing the edges so the butter is completely encased in the dough.

##### step 4: laminating the dough
1. roll the dough into a long, narrow rectangle, approximately 8 inches by 24 inches (20 cm by 60 cm). keep the work surface and dough lightly floured.
2. fold the dough in thirds, like a letter, by folding one end towards the middle, and then the other end on top. this is called a single fold (or a ""turn"").
3. wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes.
4. after chilling, repeat the rolling and folding process for a total of three times, making sure to chill the dough between each fold for at least 30 minutes to keep the butter firm.

##### step 5: cutting and shaping
1. after the last fold, chill the dough for 1 hour. then roll the dough out to a 1/4-inch (about 6 mm) thickness, maintaining a rectangle shape.
2. cut the dough into long, triangular strips, each base approximately 4 inches (10 cm) wide.
3. gently stretch each triangle a little, and then roll it up from the base to the tip to form the classic croissant shape, ensuring that the tip is tucked underneath the croissant.

##### step 6: proofing
1. arrange the shaped croissants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, providing enough space for them to rise.
2. cover loosely with a lightly oiled plastic wrap and allow them to proof until puffy and nearly doubled in size (between 1 to 2 hours in a warm environment).

##### step 7: baking
1. preheat the oven to 400°f (200°c).
2. prepare the egg wash by beating the egg with a splash of water.
3. gently brush the egg wash over the proofed croissants.
4. bake the croissants for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and flaky.
