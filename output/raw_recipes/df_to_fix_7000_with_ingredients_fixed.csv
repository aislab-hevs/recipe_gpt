- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon (plus more for garnish)

- butter for greasing the dish (if baking)

"|"1. rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.

2. in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the rice, milk, and salt. if you're using a piece of citrus peel, add it now.

3. bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan.

4. when the mixture starts to thicken (after about 15-20 minutes), add the sugar, and continue to cook, frequently stirring to ensure the mixture doesn't burn or stick. this process can take 30-40 minutes depending on the type of rice and the desired consistency.

"|vegan|200.0|contains gluten|food_574|"- 2 cups of dried chickpeas (soaked overnight in water)
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2-3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for a spicy kick)
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom (optional)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1-2 tablespoons flour or chickpea flour (optional, if needed for binding)
- 2-3 tablespoons olive oil

2. **drain & blend chickpeas:** drain the chickpeas that you've soaked overnight. do not use canned chickpeas for this recipe as they're too moist. place the chickpeas in a food processor.

3. **add aromatics & herbs:** add the chopped onion, minced garlic, parsley, cilantro, salt, black pepper, cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper, and cardamom to the food processor.

4. **process mixture:** pulse the mixture several times until it resembles coarse bread crumbs. you want to avoid over-processing the mixture; it should not become a paste. it's important for good textured falafel that the chickpeas remain granular.

5. **add dry ingredients:** transfer the mixture to a bowl, and stir in the baking powder and 1 tablespoon of flour. if the mixture still doesn't hold together, you can add a little more flour just until it's possible to form patties.

6. **form patties or balls:** using your hands or a falafel scoop, form the chickpea mixture into balls or patties about 1.5 inches in diameter. flatten them slightly if you prefer patties for a more even baking.

7. **place on baking sheet:** arrange the falafel on the prepared baking sheet. brush the top of each falafel with a little olive oil; this helps to get a good golden color and a crispy outer layer.

8. **bake:** place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes, flipping the falafels halfway through the baking time, until they are golden on both sides.

9. **serve:** serve your baked falafel hot on a bed of greens, in a pita, with a tahini sauce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and any other accompaniments you enjoy.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the finely chopped cabbage, mushrooms, grated carrots, chopped green onions, minced garlic, and grated ginger.
Add soy sauce (or tamari), sesame oil, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using) to the bowl. Mix everything well until the filling is evenly seasoned.
Assemble the Gyoza:

Take a gyoza wrapper and place it in the palm of your hand or on a clean surface.
Spoon about 1 to 1.5 teaspoons of the filling mixture into the center of the wrapper.
Wet the edge of the wrapper with a little water using your fingertip.
Fold the wrapper in half, creating a half-moon shape, and press the edges together to seal. You can leave the edges plain or make pleats for a decorative touch.
Repeat the process until all the filling is used up, and you have a batch of gyoza ready for cooking.

Cook the Gyoza:

Heat a large non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat.
Add 1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oil to the pan and swirl it around to coat the bottom evenly.
Place the gyoza in the pan, ensuring they are not touching each other.
Cook for 2-3 minutes until the bottoms are golden brown.
Steaming:

After browning the bottoms, carefully pour 1/2 cup of water into the pan.
Quickly cover the pan with a lid, reduce the heat to medium, and steam the gyoza for about 5-6 minutes, or until the wrappers become translucent and the filling is cooked through.
Remove the lid and let the gyoza cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the bottoms become crispy again.

Prepare the Dipping Sauce:

While the gyoza are cooking, mix soy sauce (or tamari), rice vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, and grated ginger in a small bowl. Stir until the sugar dissolves.
Serve:

Carefully remove the gyoza from the pan, place them on a plate, and serve them hot.
Garnish with red pepper flakes or sliced green onions if desired.
Serve with the dipping sauce on the side.
Enjoy your delicious Vegan Gyoza!

- 4 slices of rustic bread (such as a baguette or ciabatta)
- 2 ripe tomatoes, halved
- 1-2 cloves of garlic, peeled and cut in half
- extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling
- coarse salt (sea salt or kosher salt), to taste
- optional: serrano ham or anchovies, for topping

**"|"

1. **toast the bread:**
   - preheat your oven broiler or grill, or use a toaster.
   - lightly toast the slices of bread until they're golden and crispy. you can grill or broil them for about 1 to 2 minutes per side, depending on the heat.

2. **rub with garlic:**
   - once the bread is toasted, while it's still warm, rub one side of each slice with the cut side of the garlic cloves. the rough texture of the toasted bread will help grate the garlic and infuse it into the bread.

3. **grate or rub the tomato:**
   - cut the tomatoes in half crosswise. using the larger grated side of a box grater, grate the tomato halves over a bowl, being careful to keep the skin intact. alternatively, you can simply rub the cut side of the tomato halves directly onto the toasted bread. the goal is to coat the bread with the tomato flesh.

4. **drizzle with olive oil:**
   - generously drizzle olive oil over the tomato-coated bread. the bread should have a nice sheen of oil but not be overly saturated.

5. **season:**
   - sprinkle coarse salt over the slices to taste. 

6. **optional toppings:**
   - if you want to add a layer of flavor, you can top the bread with thin slices of serrano ham or a few anchovies.

7. **serve:**

- 1/2 cup (120ml) molasses or pekmez (grape molasses)
- 1/2 cup (120ml) water
- 1-1.5 cups (150-225g) sesame seeds, for coating

### "|"1. **activate the yeast:**
   - in a small bowl, mix the yeast, sugar, and 1/2 cup of the warm water. let it sit for about 5 minutes, or until it becomes frothy, signaling that the yeast is active.

2. **prepare the dough:**
   - in a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture, oil, and the remaining warm water.
   - mix everything together to form a dough. you can start with a wooden spoon and then use your hands to ensure all ingredients are well incorporated.

3. **knead the dough:**
   - transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until you have a smooth and elastic dough.
   - place the dough back in the mixing bowl (you can first clean and lightly oil the bowl), cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, which will take about 1 hour.

4. **sesame seed mixture:**
   - while the dough is resting, prepare your sesame seed coating. in one bowl, mix the molasses and 1/2 cup of water. in another bowl, place the sesame seeds.

5. **shape the simit:**
   - once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.
   - roll each piece into about a 30-inch long rope. then twist two ropes together and join the ends to form a circle, ensuring it's well sealed.

6. **coat the simit:**
   - preheat your oven to 450°f (230°c) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
   - dip each simit firstly into the molasses water mixture, ensuring it's fully coated, and then dredge it in the sesame seeds, covering it evenly. place the coated simits on the prepared baking sheet.

7. **second rise:**
   - allow the simits to rest for an additional 15-20 minutes on the tray so that they can puff up slightly.

8. **bake:**
   - place the tray in the preheated oven and bake for about 15-20 minutes or until they turn a beautiful golden brown color.

9. **cooling:**
   - remove the simits from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack. they are best enjoyed fresh, while still slightly warm.

10. **serve:**
    - enjoy your turkish simit with a cup of turkish tea, some slices of feta cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, or olives for an authentic experience.

please note, the texture and taste of a simit largely depend on the right consistency and quality of the dough, as well as the correct baking time and temperature. if it's your first time making simit, you might need a couple of attempts to perfect it. enjoy your baking!"|4.2|32.0|32.0|4.2|salty|baked|grain-based||Turkish|2|flour, yeast, sugar, water, salt, vegetable, olive, molasses, pekmez, grape, molasses, water, sesame, seed, coating

3. add the shredded chicken to the skillet with the onions and garlic. stir everything to combine well.

4. pour the barbecue sauce over the chicken mixture. stir thoroughly, ensuring that all the chicken is coated with sauce. if the mixture seems too dry, you can add a bit more sauce to reach the desired consistency.

5. season with salt and pepper to taste. reduce the heat to low and simmer the chicken and sauce mixture for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

6. while the chicken is simmering, toast the sandwich buns. you can do this in a toaster, under a broiler, or on a grill for a few minutes until lightly crispy.

7. assemble the sandwiches. place a generous amount of the bbq pulled chicken onto the bottom half of each bun, add your favorite toppings like coleslaw or pickles if desired, and then top with the other half of the bun.

8. serve immediately while hot.

2. take your prosciutto slices and, if they are large, cut them in half so that they are easier to work with. you want each piece to be just large enough to wrap around a melon ball.

3. wrap each melon ball or cube with a piece of prosciutto. the prosciutto should stick to itself to stay wrapped around the melon. if it doesn't, you can use a toothpick to secure it.

4. arrange the melon and prosciutto cups on a platter. if desired, you can place each one in an individual serving dish, like a mini cupcake liner or on a small spoon, for an elegant presentation.

5. garnish with fresh mint leaves if you're using them. the mint will add a refreshing flavor contrast to the melon and prosciutto.

6. as an optional step, you can drizzle a small amount of balsamic glaze or vinegar over the top of the prosciutto cups. this adds a touch of acidity and sweetness that complements the other flavors.

7. finish with a sprinkle of black pepper, if desired, to taste.

8. serve immediately, or refrigerate until ready to serve. remember that prosciutto can dry out if left uncovered in the refrigerator for too long, so it's best to serve these within a few hours of assembling.

3. **mushrooms and green onions**: if using, slice the mushrooms thinly. then, slice the green onions, separating the white and green parts. the white parts will be cooked, while the green parts will be used as a garnish.

4. **start the soup**: pour the water into a large pot and bring it to a low simmer. do not boil as this may affect the miso flavor. if you're using ginger and optional soy sauce for extra flavor, add them now to infuse the water.

5. **miso paste**: take a small bowl and whisk together the miso paste with a bit of the hot water from the pot, until it forms a smooth mixture with no lumps.

6. **combine ingredients**: lower the heat and add the hydrated seaweed, tofu cubes, and if using, the white parts of the green onions and shiitake mushrooms into the pot. allow these ingredients to warm through for a few minutes.

7. **add the miso**: turn off the heat completely before adding the miso paste mixture to the pot. stir gently until everything is well combined. it is important not to boil miso as it can kill the beneficial probiotics in it and alter the flavor.

8. **final touches**: serve the miso soup in bowls, garnishing with the sliced green parts of the onions. if desired, add a couple drops of sesame oil on top for added richness.

9. **adjust flavors**: taste the soup and adjust seasoning if necessary, but be cautious with salt as miso paste is already salty.

2. **prepare the zucchini:**
   trim the ends off each zucchini and slice them in half lengthwise. using a spoon or a melon baller, scoop out the seeds and some of the flesh to create a hollow ""boat"". be careful not to puncture the skin. this flesh can be saved for another recipe or discarded.

3. **season and bake zucchini:**
   place the zucchini halves on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. you can also add minced garlic for more flavor. bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes or until they are just starting to soften.

4. **mix filling:**
   while the zucchini is baking, in a bowl, combine diced tomatoes, shredded mozzarella, chopped basil (reserve some basil for garnish), salt, and pepper. you can also add a drizzle of olive oil to this mixture.

5. **stuff the zucchini:**
   remove the zucchini from the oven. if they have released a lot of water, you can blot them with a paper towel. fill each zucchini boat with the tomato and mozzarella mixture.

6. **bake again:**
   return the stuffed zucchini boats to the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the zucchini are tender.

7. **drizzle balsamic glaze:**
   optionally, while the zucchini boats are still warm, drizzle them with balsamic vinegar or glaze and a bit of extra virgin olive oil.

8. **garnish and serve:**
   sprinkle the remaining chopped basil over the top of the zucchini boats for garnish. serve while warm.

- Origin: United Kingdom

"|NotRestriction|250.0||food_8204|"- 2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1/3 cup (75 grams) granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda

- optional: 1/2 cup raisins or other dried fruit, chocolate chips, or nuts

### "|"1. **preheat your oven** to 400 degrees f (200 degrees c). line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. **mix dry ingredients**: in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

3. **cut in the butter**: add the cold, cubed butter to the dry ingredients. use a pastry cutter, two forks, or your fingers to rub the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.

4. **combine wet ingredients**: in a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream and egg until smooth.

5. **add wet ingredients to dry**: pour the sour cream mixture into the flour and butter mixture, and fold with a spatula just until the dough begins to come together. if you've chosen to add any optional ingredients like raisins or chocolate chips, fold them in now.

6. **form the scones**: transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead it gently until it forms a cohesive ball. pat the dough into a circle about 3/4-inch thick. 

7. **cut the scones**: use a biscuit cutter or a sharp knife to cut out scone shapes. if using a knife, you can cut the dough into triangles or squares as per your preference.

8. **bake**: place the scones onto the prepared baking sheet. bake for 15-17 minutes, or until they are golden brown on the top and around the edges.

9. **cool**: allow the scones to cool on the baking sheet for a couple of minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

6172|Paratha|"46. Paratha:
- Calories per portion: 200 kcal
- Total portions: 1
- Origin: India

"|NotRestriction|200.0||food_8217|"- 2 cups of whole wheat flour (atta), plus extra for dusting
- 1/2 to 3/4 cup of water (use as needed to knead the dough)
- 2 tablespoons of ghee or oil, plus extra for cooking
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt (optional)

### "|"1. **make the dough:**
   - in a large bowl, mix the whole wheat flour and salt.
   - gradually add water in increments, kneading as you go until you have a soft, pliable dough. it should not be too sticky or too dry.
   - add a little ghee or oil towards the end and knead it in to make the dough smoother.
   - cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. this helps the gluten relax and makes the dough easier to roll out.

2. **divide the dough:**
   - after resting, knead the dough again for a couple of minutes.
   - divide the dough into equal-sized balls. the size of each ball will determine the size of the paratha, so around golf ball size is standard.

3. **roll the parathas:**
   - take one dough ball and press it flat.
   - dust it lightly with flour and roll it out into a circle approximately 6 inches in diameter, like a tortilla. if the dough sticks to the rolling surface or pin, dust it lightly with more flour.
   - apply a thin layer of ghee or oil over the surface of the rolled-out dough (optional, helps create flaky layers).
   
4. **cook the parathas:**
   - heat a flat pan or tawa on medium heat. once it's hot, place the rolled-out dough onto the pan.
   - cook for about 20-30 seconds, or until you see the dough change color and puff up in places. flip the paratha using a spatula.
   - apply a bit of ghee or oil on the partially cooked side, and flip again.
   - cook until both sides have golden brown spots, applying ghee or oil on the new side as well before flipping.
   - press gently with a spatula on puffed parts to help heat distribute evenly.

5. **serve:**
   - continue with the remaining dough balls.
   - as you cook each paratha, you can keep them warm wrapped in a clean cloth or in an insulated container until you're ready to serve.
   - serve hot with any side dish of your choice, like yogurt, pickle, curry, or dal.

#### tips:

- you can add different fillings like mashed potato, paneer (indian cheese), spinach, or radish to make stuffed parathas. the process of rolling out and cooking will be the same, but you will put the filling in between two thinly rolled dough circles or place it in the center of one, fold into a parcel, and then roll it flat again before cooking.
- getting the cooking temperature and time right is crucial. if the heat is too high, the parathas may burn. if it's too low, they might become hard.
- practice makes perfect when it comes to making round and evenly cooked parathas, so don't be discouraged if they're not perfect the first time!

- 3 cups of all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1 tablespoon of sugar
- 1 cup of water (or as needed to form a dough)
- 1 large egg (optional, for extra richness)
- 2 tablespoons of condensed milk (optional, for extra richness and sweetness)
- 2 tablespoons of ghee or unsalted butter, melted, plus extra for greasing and cooking
- vegetable oil, for greasing

"|"**

1. **dough making:**
   - in a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. 
   - if you're using egg and condensed milk, whisk them together with the water before adding to the dry ingredients; otherwise, just slowly add water to the dry ingredients.
   - gradually add the water (with the egg and condensed milk mixture if you're using it), mixing until the dough begins to come together. 
   - pour in the melted ghee or butter and knead the dough for about 10 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. you may need to adjust the amount of water or flour slightly to get the right consistency.

2. **dough resting:**
   - divide the dough into small balls (about golf ball size or slightly larger).
   - grease each ball lightly with vegetable oil.
   - place the dough balls on a tray or plate, making sure they're not touching, and cover loosely with plastic wrap. 
   - let them rest for at least 4 hours, or overnight. this resting period allows the gluten in the dough to relax, which will make it easier to stretch the roti canai later.

   - when ready to cook, work with one ball of dough at a time on a lightly oiled countertop.
   - flatten the ball and start stretching it with your hands to form a very thin sheet. you can lift and toss the dough or use your fingers to stretch it out. the goal is to get it as thin as possible without tearing, aiming for a translucent sheet.

4. **shaping:**
   - once the dough is stretched, fold the edges in to form a rectangle; fold the top and bottom edges towards the center, then fold the left and right edges.
   - you can also roll the stretched dough like a rug from one end to the other, then coil into a round snail shape and tuck the end underneath.

5. **cooking:**
   - heat a non-stick pan or flat griddle over medium heat.
   - flatten the shaped dough slightly with your hands, then use a rolling pin to roll it out to your desired thickness.
   - grease the pan with a little bit of ghee or oil and place the roti canai on it.
   - cook until the underside is golden brown and crispy, then flip it to cook the other side.
   - while it's cooking, you can also press the edges and lightly toss or flip the roti in the pan to ensure even cooking.
   - remove from the pan when both sides are cooked, and it's crispy and flaky.
   - as an optional step, you can clap the roti between your hands to fluff it up and separate the layers, making it more fluffy and airy.

6. **serving:**
   - roti canai is traditionally served with dhal (lentil curry), chicken curry, or any other type of curry. 
   - fold or roll the roti into quarters and serve it warm alongside your dip or curry of choice.

Prepare the Noodles:

Cook the noodles according to package instructions until al dente.
Drain and rinse the noodles under cold water to stop the cooking process and prevent them from sticking together.
Toss the noodles with a bit of sesame oil to prevent sticking and set aside.
Prepare the Sauce:

In a small bowl, mix together 3-4 tablespoons of fermented yellow soybean paste (Huangjiang), 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Adjust the quantities to your taste preference.
Stir until the soybean paste is well combined with the other ingredients. Set the sauce aside.
Cook the Ground Pork or Beef:

Heat a bit of cooking oil in a pan or wok over medium heat.
Add minced garlic and ginger to the pan and sauté until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.
Add the ground pork or beef to the pan and cook, breaking it apart with a spatula, until browned and cooked through.
Once cooked, drain excess fat if necessary.
Combine Sauce and Meat:

Lower the heat and add the prepared sauce to the cooked meat in the pan.
Stir well to combine, ensuring that the meat is evenly coated with the sauce.
Allow the mixture to simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
Assemble the Dish:

Place a portion of cooked noodles in serving bowls.
Spoon the meat and sauce mixture over the noodles.
Optionally, garnish with julienned cucumber, shredded carrots, and chopped green onions for added texture and freshness.
Serve:

Serve the Zhajiangmian hot, allowing each diner to mix the noodles and sauce together before eating.
You can also serve it with additional soy sauce or chili oil on the side for those who prefer extra flavor or spice.
Enjoy your homemade Zhajiangmian!

  1 Large Yellow Onion 
  Diced 
  Salt And Black Pepper 
  4 cloves Garlic 
  Finely Minced 
  12 ounces 
  fluid Light Beer (like A Pilsner) 
  4 cups Low Sodium Chicken Broth 
  1/3 cups All-purpose Flour 
  2-1/2 cups Low Fat Milk 
  1/4 cups Cayenne Pepper Sauce (like Frank's - More Or Less To Taste) 
  1-3/4 cup Shredded Sharp White Cheddar Cheese 
  1/4 cups Bleu Cheese Crumbles 
  1-1/2 cup Fully-cooked Shredded Chicken Breast 
  Croutons 
  Chopped Chives 
  Crispy Bacon 
  Bleu Cheese Crumbles 
  Frank's Red Hot Sauce (for Toppings)In a large Dutch oven 
  heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and season with salt and black pepper. Cook for 5-6 minutes or until tender. Add the garlic and cook for another minute 
  or until fragrant. Add the beer. Bring to a boil and then lower to a simmer. Simmer for about 15 minutes or until the beer is substantially reduced. 
  Add the chicken broth. Using an immersion blender 
  blend the mixture until completely smooth. Alternately 
  you can use a regular blender if you don't have an immersion blender on hand. If you do this 
  make sure to blend in small batches and allow space for the hot soup to expand in the blender. 
  Bring the soup to a boil and then lower to a simmer. Simmer for an additional 15 minutes. 
  In a large bowl 
  whisk together the flour and just enough milk to create a paste (about 1/4-1/3 of a cup). Whisk the flour into the soup and then add the remaining milk. Continue to simmer the soup for another 15 minutes 
  whisking frequently until the soup has thickened slightly. Stir in the hot sauce. Cook for an additional 3 minutes and then remove from heat. 
  In 1/2 cup increments add the cheddar cheese and blue cheese crumbles to the soup 
  stirring and melting the cheeses completely before adding the next addition. It's OK if a few chunks of blue cheese remain. Stir in the shredded chicken breast.
