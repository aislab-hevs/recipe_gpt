4. **beat the egg whites** until stiff peaks form. this will help give the waffles that traditional fluffy texture.

5. **mix the wet ingredients** with the egg yolks. whisk together the milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract.

6. **combine the wet and dry ingredients**. pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense waffles.

7. **fold in the egg whites**. gently fold the beaten egg whites into the batter, trying not to deflate them too much. this will contribute to the light and airy consistency of the waffles.

8. **prepare the waffle iron**. brush or spray the waffle iron with oil to ensure the waffles don't stick.

9. **cook the waffles**. pour an appropriate amount of batter onto the preheated waffle iron (the amount will depend on the size of your waffle iron; usually, it's about 1/2 cup to 1 cup). spread the batter close to the edges, and close the lid. cook according to the waffle iron's instructions, or until the waffles are golden brown and crisp.

10. **serve the waffles** hot. remove the waffle carefully from the iron and serve immediately. dress your waffles with powdered sugar, syrup, fruits, whipped cream, or your favorite toppings.

6936|Rum Raisin Cinnamon Buns|"Rum Raisin Cinnamon Buns1 cup Raisins 
  1/8 cups Rum 
  2 cups All-purpose Flour 
  1 package Active Dry Yeast 
  0.25 Ounce Packet 
  1/4 cups Granulated Sugar 
  1/2 teaspoons Salt 
  1/4 cups Water 
  1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract 
  1/3 cups Milk 
  1/2 sticks Butter 
  2 Eggs 
  3/4 cups All-purpose Flour 
  1/2 cups Granulated Sugar 
  2 Tablespoons Butter 
  Softened 
  2 teaspoons Cinnamon1. Measure out 1 cup of raisins and put them in a small bowl. Pour the rum over the raisins 
  stir 
  cover the bowl and set aside. The rum will soak into the raisins. 
  2. In a large bowl measure out the 2 cups of flour 
  yeast 
  sugar 
  and salt. Set aside. Also 
  in a separate cup measure out the water and add the vanilla to the water. Set that aside as well. 
  3. In a small sauce pan add the milk and butter over medium-low heat. Heat just until the butter melts. Remove from heat. Add the water/vanilla mixture to the milk mixture and let the mixture cool to 100-110 F using a thermometer. (If you go to my old recipe 
  you will notice that I finally upgraded from my dingy meat thermometer!) 
  4. Once the mixture is at the right temperature 
  pour the liquid into the flour 
  salt 
  sugar and yeast mixture. Mix to combine. Add the eggs and the last 3/4 cup of flour and mix. The dough will slowly come together. 
  5. Butter all around the inside of a large bowl. Plop the dough into the greased bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap and a dishtowel. Set the bowl aside in a warm 
  shaded place for one hour. The yeast will be all happy and warm and fed and start working to grow the dough. It should almost double in size 
  not quite. But it will definitely look bigger than what you put in there to begin with. If it doesn't 
  you can give it more time...or the yeast could just be old and didn't activate. If that's the case 
  you may need to start over. 
  6. When it's ready 
  lightly flour your work surface and knead your dough 10 times 
  by folding it into itself. 
  7. Then 
  roll your dough out flat using a rolling pin. Mix together the raisin/rum 
  1/2 cup of sugar 
  2 tablespoons of softened butter and cinnamon and spread it evenly over the flat dough. 
  8. Starting at the bottom 
  roll the dough up so that in the end you just have one long log. 
  9. Cut it into 9-10 slices and place the slices into a greased/buttered 
  9x9 pan. 
  10. Cover this with plastic and a dish towel for 45 minutes to let it proof again. Preheat your oven to 350 F. 
  11. After the last proof 
  remove the plastic and towel and bake for 27-30 minutes until dark golden brown and bubbly.
