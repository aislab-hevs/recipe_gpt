  If you're multiplying the recipe 
  you will still want to steep it in containers no bigger than about a quart 
  dividing the spices up between them. The flavor doesn't seem to develop as well in bigger containers. I've bought a box of quart canning jars that I re-use every year. 
  Steep for three weeks in a cool 
  dark place 
  shaking or swirling around in the container every two or three days. 
  Strain out the spices and discard. 
  Line a funnel 
  a sieve or a coffee cone with a dampened coffee filter and pour the liqueur through. Change the filter regularly. This is a SLOW process! 
  When I make this for holiday gifts 
  I make such a quantity--seven or eight times this recipe--I'd get old and gray waiting for it to filter this way. So I invested around $20 in a gold-plated permanent coffee filter (look for them in a good kitchen shop). It's much faster and the results are a tiny bit more cloudy

  2-3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf Italian parsley 
  1 tablespoon butter for finishing 
  salt 
  to taste 
  2-3 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil 
  for drizzling"|"Heat broth in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Once it's hot 
  lower to a simmer. 
  Bring a large pot (big enough to submerge the lobster completely) of salted water to a boil. To kill the lobster 
  hold a butcher knife over its head 
  about an inch behind its eyes; puncture and slice forward in one motion. Plunge the lobster head first into the boiling water for 7-8 minutes. The shell should be bright red 
  though the meat will finish cooking in the risotto. Remove the lobster from the pot 
  rinse 
  and allow to cool. 
  To remove the meat 
  twist off the claws; crack them open with nut crackers 
  and extract the meat. Bend the lobster's body back from the tail until it cracks; remove it. Then push the tail meat out. Crack the lobster body open and break off the legs; use a skewer to push the meat out of the legs. 
  For the risotto 
  saute the shallots in olive oil and butter. Add the Arborio rice; toast for 1 minute. Cook the risotto at a slow simmer 
  adding heated broth 1/2 cupful at a time. Most cookbooks will tell to stir continuously; I don't 
  and you don't have to either. You can stir occasionally; just make sure the risotto absorbs the liquid before adding more. It will become tender and creamy as it cooks. Season will some salt about halfway through so it blends well 
  and add the white wine. Add the tomatoes with their juices. 4 cups of broth works for this recipe 
  but use more or less as desired. I prefer a soupier risotto for this recipe since it makes the lobster that much more tender. Add the lobster meat to the risotto 
  and cook 4-5 minutes. 
  It takes about 20 minutes total for the risotto to become completely cooked. Taste it -- it should be wonderfully creamy and thick. It's best al dente 
  which means it should still retain some firmness when you chew it. Season with salt and pepper. Remove risotto from heat 
  and add 1 tablespoon butter for added creaminess. Add fresh parsley 
  and stir well. 
  Plate your risotto. Top it with a sprinkling of fresh parsley and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and serve immediately."|1528|119|196|26.8|87|Salty|2|Baked|Asian|45.0|meat-based|Crustacean shellfish

357|Peanut Sauce'D Tofu & Turmeric Zoodles|"1 One container of tofu 
  cut into 1/2 inch pieces. Extra firm tofu works well. (I prefer Nasoya) 
  1 cup Zucchini 
  1 cup Yellow squash 
  1/2 Red onion 
  2 Garlic cloves 
  1/2 cup Snap peas 
  1/2 cup Red and yellow peppers 
  1/3 cup Peanuts (chopped) 
  1/2 cup Chick peas 
  3 tablespoons Chunky raw peanut butter 
  1 teaspoon Turmeric 
  1 teaspoon Black pepper 
  1 teaspoon Mustard powder 
  1 teaspoon Curry powder 
  1 tablespoon Thai red curry paste 
  2 tablespoons Coconut oil 
  1/4 teaspoon Ginger powder 
  1 teaspoon Soy sauce 
  1 cup Coconut milk"|"In a bowl 
  mix the peanut butter 
  red curry paste 
  and ginger until it is smooth. To thin out the mixture if it is too thick 
  you can add a tablespoon of water or coconut milk. Cut up your tofu into the 1/2 inch cubes and in a bowl combine the two 
  coating the tofu thoroughly with the mixture. The idea is to marinate the tofu the way you'd marinate a chicken or a steak- you want the flavors to marry! Let the tofu set aside while you prepare the rest of the meal. 
  Next 
  you'll want to create your zoodles. I suggest using the Veggetti or a Spiralizer. Create your zoodles with the zucchini and the yellow squash. While the recipe calls for a cup of each 
  you can use the entire zucchini or squash and enjoy the leftovers the next day! 
  Put your zoodles aside. Next 
  you'll cut up your red onion and red and yellow peppers. I like to cut them into long 
  thin pieces 
  but if you prefer bigger chunks of peppers that works too! This recipe is all about personal preference. You can also chop up your garlic cloves 
  your snap peas (I cut them into halves) and your peanuts. Now to the stove! 
  In a large sauce pan on low to medium heat place 2 tablespoons of coconut oil (extra virgin olive oil works too) onto the pan. Once it heats up a bit (1-3 minutes) 
  place your zoodles 
  your can of drained chick peas 
  your onion and your garlic into the pan. Once they get cooking 
  add a teaspoon of curry powder 
  a teaspoon of black pepper 
  a teaspoon of mustard powder 
  and a teaspoon of turmeric. Mix in the soy sauce. Allow the zoodles to cook down (3-5 minutes). Stir frequently. 
  Once the zoodles have cooked down 
  add 1/2 cup of coconut milk as well as the tofu. Allow to steam for 8-10 minutes. Optional: if you want 
  you can cook the tofu in a separate pan to create a little crust for 3-5 minutes while your zoodles are cooking. Just add a teaspoon of coconut oil to a pan over medium heat and stir frequently 
  then add to your zoodles. 
  Once the zoodles have cooked down 
  throw in the red and yellow peppers 
  as well as the snap peas and the peanuts. Allow another 2-3 minutes of cooking.

  cooked green peas

  for garnish"|"Add oil to a wok and heat over high heat until oil reaches 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer. Set the wok's spatula in the oil as it heats so that the spatula is heated as well; this will help prevent the black bean sauce from sticking to the spatula when it's added. 
  Add black bean sauce and fry 
  stirring constantly 
  until black bean sauce begins to look just slightly curdled. Immediately transfer to a heatproof container 
  along with all the frying oil. It's better to err on the side of less frying if you're unsure 
  as over-fried black bean sauce will clump up and be difficult to work with later. 
  In a small saucepan of simmering water 
  poach shrimp until just pink on the outside and still undercooked in the center 
  about 30 seconds. Drain. Shell shrimp and cut into 1/4-inch dice. 
  In a clean wok 
  heat about 3 tablespoons (45ml) vegetable oil over high heat until smoking. (You can use some of the vegetable oil from the bean-frying step 
  if you stir-fried the beans.) Add pork belly and spread in an even layer. Allow to sear for 30 seconds 
  then begin stirring and tossing constantly until pork is browned all over 
  about 30 seconds longer. (If you're working over gas 
  you may get some flare-ups; they'll die down quickly and enhance the flavor of the stir-fry.) 
  Add scallion 
  ginger 
  and about 3 tablespoons diced onion 
  then cook 
  stirring and tossing 
  until fragrant 
  about 20 seconds. Add soy sauce 
  pouring it down the side of the wok to make it sizzle. Cook 
  stirring 
  for 10 seconds longer. 
  Add potato and squid and cook 
  stirring and tossing constantly 
  until potato is about half cooked 
  about 3 minutes. Add remaining onion and cook 
  stirring and tossing 
  until onion has softened 
  about 1 minute. Working in 1-tablespoon (15ml) additions 
  add black bean sauce (without too much of the oil it was fried with) 
  tossing to coat all the ingredients; exactly how much you add will depend on your taste 
  but your goal is a rich black bean character and very dark brown color throughout. (We ended up adding about 5 heaping tablespoons of the black bean sauce we used.) 
  Add shrimp and toss to combine. Add oyster sauce and sugar and stir well to incorporate. Season with black pepper. Add water 
  1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time 
  until the mixture has thinned enough to create a thick but flowing sauce. Continue cooking until potato is just cooked through; stir often and lower heat as needed to prevent scorching. 
  Add more water as needed 
  roughly 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time 
  to reach a saucy consistency; if sauce becomes too thin 
  add 1 teaspoon (5ml) potato-starch slurry and bring to a simmer to help thicken the liquid. Repeat this process 
  adjusting with small amounts of water and slurry as needed 
  until the sauce is glossy and thick but slowly pourable. Adjust seasoning with more oyster sauce or soy sauce as desired.

  1/4 cups Granulated Sugar 
  1/2 teaspoons Salt

  1/2 sticks Butter 
  2 Eggs 
  3/4 cups All-purpose Flour 
  1/2 cups Granulated Sugar 
  2 Tablespoons Butter 
  Softened 
  2 teaspoons Cinnamon"|"1. Measure out 1 cup of raisins and put them in a small bowl. Pour the rum over the raisins 
  stir 
  cover the bowl and set aside. The rum will soak into the raisins. 
  2. In a large bowl measure out the 2 cups of flour 
  yeast 
  sugar 
  and salt. Set aside. Also 
  in a separate cup measure out the water and add the vanilla to the water. Set that aside as well. 
  3. In a small sauce pan add the milk and butter over medium-low heat. Heat just until the butter melts. Remove from heat. Add the water/vanilla mixture to the milk mixture and let the mixture cool to 100-110 F using a thermometer. (If you go to my old recipe 
  you will notice that I finally upgraded from my dingy meat thermometer!) 
  4. Once the mixture is at the right temperature 
  pour the liquid into the flour 
  salt 
  sugar and yeast mixture. Mix to combine. Add the eggs and the last 3/4 cup of flour and mix. The dough will slowly come together. 
  5. Butter all around the inside of a large bowl. Plop the dough into the greased bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap and a dishtowel. Set the bowl aside in a warm 
  shaded place for one hour. The yeast will be all happy and warm and fed and start working to grow the dough. It should almost double in size 
  not quite. But it will definitely look bigger than what you put in there to begin with. If it doesn't 
  you can give it more time...or the yeast could just be old and didn't activate. If that's the case 
  you may need to start over. 
  6. When it's ready 
  lightly flour your work surface and knead your dough 10 times 
  by folding it into itself. 
  7. Then 
  roll your dough out flat using a rolling pin. Mix together the raisin/rum 
  1/2 cup of sugar 
  2 tablespoons of softened butter and cinnamon and spread it evenly over the flat dough. 
  8. Starting at the bottom 
  roll the dough up so that in the end you just have one long log. 
  9. Cut it into 9-10 slices and place the slices into a greased/buttered 
  9x9 pan. 
  10. Cover this with plastic and a dish towel for 45 minutes to let it proof again. Preheat your oven to 350 F. 
  11. After the last proof 
  remove the plastic and towel and bake for 27-30 minutes until dark golden brown and bubbly.

  2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 
  3 1/2 to 4 cups flour 
  4 eggs 
  1/2 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil"|"1 recipe basic pasta dough 
  recipe follows 
  Heat the oil in a large heavy saute pan over medium heat. 
  Add the onions 
  garlic and a light sprinkling of salt and pepper. 
  Stir them lightly to coat in the oil 
  then cover the pan and lower the heat to the lowest possible setting. 
  Cook 10 to 15 minutes 
  or until the onions are soft and almost transparent. 
  Once the onions' natural sweetness has been accentuated by the slow cooking 
  you can bring out their rich savory side with browning. 
  Uncover and raise the heat to medium-high or high. 
  Saute the onions to deep golden brown 
  stirring often with a wooden spatula and scraping up the brown glaze collecting on the bottom of the pan. 
  Take care not to let the glaze burn. 
  If necessary 
  lower the heat slightly. 
  Onions will resemble a thick 
  dark amber marmalade. 
  Set aside. 
  Roll the pasta dough out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine. 
  Cut the sheet of pasta into rectangles that are 1-inch by 2-inches. 
  Pinch the long center of each square to form the strichettoni 
  or bow ties. 
  Place the pasta on a sheet tray dusted with semolina until ready to cook 
  and cover with damp 
  clean kitchen towels. 
  Bring 6 quarts of salted water to a fierce boil. 
  To finish the sauce 
  reheat the onion mixture over medium-high to high heat and add the cream. 
  Stir until the cream begins to bubble. 
  Drop the pasta in the boiling water and cook until tender yet still firm 
  about 3 to 4 minutes. 
  Stir the prosciutto 
  parsley 
  scallions and herbs into the sauce. 
  Cook only long enough to heat through -- the fresh 
  uncooked taste of the herbs is important here. 
  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
  Drain the pasta 
  reserving the cooking liquid 
  and add it to the pan with the sauce. 
  Add the cheese and toss over high heat 1 minute 
  adding a splash of pasta cooking water if necessary to keep the sauce from being too \tight\. 
  Serve in warmed pasta dishes 
  passing the remaining cheese separately. 
  Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board. 
  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and the olive oil. 
  Using a fork 
  beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour 
  starting with the inner rim of the well. 
  As you expand the well 
  keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape. 
  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated. 
  Start kneading the dough with both hands 
  using the palms of your hands. 
  Once you have a cohesive mass 
  remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits. 
  Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes. 
  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky. 
  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. 
  Roll or shape as desired."|3975|65.6|56|31|336|Salty|2|Whipped|Mexican|30.0|Vegetarian|

  and cover with foil. 
  (I used aluminum bento cups.) 
  Microwave one at a time at 600 W for 1:50. 
  Let cool as-is. 
  If the tops have lightly browned and are set 
  it's okay 
  but if it's still soft and creamy 
  microwave some more. 
  The amount of heating time will vary depending on the size of the plate. 
  If it hasn't hardened yet 
  keep heating for 10 seconds at a time. 
  The second cup's water will have already become hot 
  so maybe 1:40 will be okay? 
  I tried covering it with a small plate. 
  This is also okay. 
  Either aluminum foil or a flipped-over lid will do fine. 
  You can heat them two at a time 
  but it will heat more evenly if you do it one at a time. 
  It's ready 
  and tastes great even when eaten plain. 
  If you don't strain it 
  the egg white and yolk... well 
  you can see what happened. 
  It's still delicious 
  but doesn't look so great. 
  If you over-heat it 
  it'll have craters. 
  Top with your favorite caramel sauce and enjoy. 
  How about trying my microwaved caramel sauce?

  1/4 cups Fat Free Sour Cream 
  3 whole Scallions/green Onions 
  Thinly Sliced 
  1 teaspoon Cumin 
  1 teaspoon Salt

  Roll each portion into a ball and then flatten it into the shape of a burger. 
  Push down on the center of the burger lightly with your thumb to make a small indention; this will keep it from turning into a baseball once it is cooked. 
  You can pan fry these burgers or cook them on a grill. 
  Lightly coat the grill or pan with oil before you turn on the heat 
  this will keep the meat from sticking. 
  The trick to grilling/cooking these burgers is to place them on a really hot grill at max heat for the first 30 seconds or so. 
  This will sear the outside making it easier to keep the burger intact when its time to be flipped. 
  Then just be sure not to touch them until they are ready to be flipped (about 5 to 6 minutes). 
  Drop the heat to medium high or a tad lower and cook for another 5 minutes or so 
  just make sure the meat is cooked on the inside and not burned on the outside. 
  You can tell the burgers are cooked when the juices run clear. 
  Again this is about 5 to 6 minutes on each side. 
  Notes: 
  1. 
  Again 
  do not use a non-stick spray on the grill once the heat is on (flammable). 
  2. 
  Cilantro would work great in this recipe if youre a fan (Im not); add a small handful 
  chopped. 
  3. 
  For a little heat 
  add a half to a whole finely diced jalapeno

  1/2 cups White Wine 
  13 cups Olive Oil 
  2 cloves Garlic 
  1 sprig Rosemary 
  1 Tablespoon Hot Or Ground Mustard 
  1 teaspoon Paprika 
  1/2 teaspoons Black Pepper"|"Combine the water 
  salt 
  and sugar into big bowl. 
  Carefully put the rabbit (whole and skinned or already portioned) into a gallon size zip lock bag. 
  Pour brine in over the rabbit (I added a sprig of fresh rosemary here 
  as well as the zest of one lemon) and seal up the bag. 
  Put back in big bowl and let rest in the fridge for one hour. 
  The brine should cover all parts of the meat (this is tenderizing the rabbit 
  which tends to get very dry during cooking). 
  Just before pulling out the rabbit 
  make the marinade/baste out of the remaining ingredients. 
  Chop the rosemary and garlic pretty finely (that way it stays on the baster rather than in the cup!) 
  and stir everything to combine. 
  Set it near the rabbit station. 
  After an hour (or more 
  I did two hours with no harm) 
  pull out the rabbit from the brine. 
  Discard the brine. 
  If your rabbit was whole 
  nows the time to carve up the rabbit. 
  I ended up grilling the legs 
  arms 
  and tenderloin (long piece of muscle that runs from below the ribcage to the tailbone) 
  and saving the rest for a stew. 
  As you cut each piece 
  dip it into the marinade and let it start flavoring while you finish the butchering. 
  On the grill 
  set it to low or medium low heat. 
  Rabbit does not have much fat on it at all 
  so it dries out really quickly. 
  Baste every five minutes. 
  Although we kept everything on for nearly the full 30 minutes 
  it would have been better to pull the tenderloin after 22-25 and the arms at 25 minutes."|27759|933.74|239|||sweet|2|Baked|Brunch|90.0|Meat-based|

  1 Egg white 
  10 grams Granulated sugar"|"Preliminaries: Spread butter on the ramekins and coat with granulated sugar. 
  Prepare hot water to bake in a hot water bath. 
  Make the chocolate custard. 
  Put the egg yolk and granulated sugar in a heatproof bowl. 
  Whisk with a whisk until it becomes white and thick. 
  Sift in cake flour and cocoa in the egg yolk mixture and mix. 
  Add milk little at a time at the beginning. 
  After adding about half of the milk 
  then add all the remaining milk and mix. 
  Heat in a 800W microwave for about 1.5 minutes. 
  Take the mixture out a few times while heating and mix. 
  Heat until it thickens. 
  Add chocolate while the mixture is still hot and mix. 
  Add rum at this point if you like. 
  Then the chocolate custard is ready. 
  Keep the custard over hot water and keep it warm. 
  Preheat the oven to 180C! 
  Make the meringue Add granulated sugar to the egg white in 2 portions and whip up until stiff peaks form using the high level on the hand mixer. 
  When the meringue is whipped 
  whip the meringue on the lowest speed with a hand mixer for the last one minute to make the meringue foam smooth and fine. 
  Then the meringue is ready. 
  Stir the chocolate custard with a whisk and make it loose. 
  Add 1/4 of the meringue and stir with the whisk to mix. 
  Add the rest of the meringue and mix gently this time like cutting the mixture using a rubber spatula to maintain the meringue foam. 
  When the mixture is mixed evenly 
  pour the batter into the ramekins to the brim. 
  Even out the surface and wipe the edges with your fingernail to remove excess batter. 
  Place a heatproof container on a baking sheet. 
  Line the container with paper towel and place the ramekins. 
  Pour the hot water for the water bath baking into the heatproof container until about half its height are covered. 
  Bake in the preheated oven Bake at 180C oven for 18 minutes. 
  (Do not open the oven door during the process 
  or the souffle will deflate.) 
  Then the fizzy~fluffy chocolate souffle is ready You can also sprinkle powdered sugar to finish for a touch. 
  Make sure to prepare things in advance because if you work slow 
  the meringue foam will burst and you'll have a deflated souffle. 
  The preparation is very important and it is the most important point to make a fluffy souffle Lining the heatproof container with paper towel at Step 12 is to prevent the ramekins from slipping. 
  You will be baking in a water bath 
  so please be careful not to burn yourself! 
  The souffle will deflate in about one minute so enjoy it while hot. 
  The ingredients are for two small ramekins. 
  If the ramekins are about 8 cm 
  I think pouring the batter to 80% full and baking might be better!

  1/4 cup cognac 
  White pepper 
  Salt 
  if needed 
  1 tablespoon minced fresh dill"|"To begin the lobster filling: Melt the butter in a saute pan which is just large enough to accommodate the lobster tails. 
  The butter should be very hot 
  but not sizzling (between 165 and 180 degrees F). 
  Add the tails to the pan 
  meat side down - shell side up 
  and poach until the lobster is opaque. 
  Remove to a utility platter and let cool. 
  (Pour the melted butter into a bowl for use in other elements in this recipe.) 
  Return 2 tablespoons of the reserved melted butter to the same saute pan and saute shallots and shiitake mushrooms until tender. 
  Add crabmeat and scallions and heat for a few minutes 
  trying to avoid breaking up lumps. 
  Set aside. 
  Return to the lobster tails 
  loosen them from the shell. 
  Reserve the shells for use in the sauce. 
  Slice the tail meat lengthwise down the middle and into 4 slices crosswise. 
  For the wrappers: Steam the cabbage leaves until tender but not mushy. 
  Remember 
  the leaves will still have to be firm enough support the lobster filling. 
  To begin the sauce: Combine the milk 
  onion 
  bay leaf 
  cloves 
  nutmeg 
  and lobster shells in a heavy-gauge 
  non-corrosive saucepan over medium heat. 
  Spoon 2 tablespoons of the reserved melted butter (from poaching the lobster) into a separate heat resistant bowl and create a slurry with the cornstarch 
  then whisk in 1/4 cup Parmesan. 
  When the milk is fairly hot 
  pour a small amount of it into the slurry 
  stirring until the milk is thoroughly blended in. 
  Return this to the remaining milk 
  add cognac 
  and simmer for 15 minutes 
  stirring frequently. 
  Remove saucepan from heat 
  season sauce 
  to taste 
  with white pepper 
  and salt if needed. 
  Remove and discard bay leaf 
  cloves and lobster shells. 
  Immediately put a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming. 
  Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Gently fold the lobster and crabmeat together with just enough of the sauce to bind it. 
  (Reserve the rest of the sauce for service.) 
  If the filling seems loose 
  add more Parmesan to bind it. 
  (You don't want the filling to be too runny.) 
  Lay the cabbage leaves out and remove stiff ribs/spines of leaves being sure to leave enough of the leaf in a shape that can be filled and rolled shut. 
  Into each leaf 
  spoon 3 or 4 tablespoons of the lobster/crabmeat mixture 
  add a few chunks of avocado 
  fold in sides of leaf 
  and roll up. 
  Place in an oven-proof dish layered on the bottom with a little of the sauce
